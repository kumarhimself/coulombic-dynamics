# Coulombic Dynamics
I was interested in creating a simulator in which Coulomb's Law governs the motion of particles. I used Godot because it allowed me to quickly set up the particle simulation and export executables for both Windows and MacOS easily.

## How to run?
Download/clone this repository and open it with the Godot game engine.
